         <p style="font-size:large;">Industrial relations
            Since its founding in 1983, Maruti Udyog Limited has experienced problems with its labour force.
            The Indian labour it hired readily accepted Japanese work culture and the modern manufacturing process.
            In 1997, there was a change in ownership, and Maruti became predominantly government controlled.
            Shortly thereafter, conflict between the United Front Government and Suzuki started. In 2000, a major industrial relations issue began and employees of Maruti went on an indefinite strike, demanding among other things, major revisions to their wages, incentives and pensions.
            Employees used slowdown in October 2000, to press a revision to their incentive-linked pay. In parallel, after elections and a new central government led by NDA alliance, India pursued a disinvestment policy.
            Along with many other government owned companies, the new administration proposed to sell part of its stake in Maruti Suzuki in a public offering. The worker's union opposed this sell-off plan on the grounds that the company will lose a major business advantage of being subsidised by the Government,
            and the union has better protection while the company remains in control of the government.
            The standoff between the union and the management continued through 2001.
            The management refused union demands citing increased competition and lower margins. The central government privatized Maruti in 2002 and Suzuki became the majority owner of Maruti Udyog Limited.
        </p>
            <br><br>
            <p style="font-size:large;">The company dismissed 500 workers accused of causing the violence and re-opened the plant on 21 August, saying it would produce 150 vehicles on the first day, less than 10% of its capacity.
                Analysts said that the shutdown was costing the company 1 billion rupees ($18 million) a day and costing the company market share.
                In July 2013, the workers went on hunger strike to protest the continuing jailing of their colleagues and launched an online campaign to support their demands.
                A total of 148 workers were charged with the murder of Human Resources Manager Avineesh Dev. The court dismissed charges against 117 of the workers. On 17 March 2017, 31 workers were found guilty of variety of offences. 18 were convicted on charges of rioting, trespassing, causing hurt and other related offences under Indian Penal Code sections. The remaining 13 workers were sentenced to life in imprisonment after being found guilty of the murder of General Manager of Human Resources Avineesh Dev.
                Twelve of the thirteen sentenced were office-bearers of the Maruti Suzuki Workers Union at the time of the alleged offences. The prosecution had sought the death penalty for the thirteen.

            <h3 id="hyundai">HYUNDAI</h3>
            <p p style="font-size:large;">Hyundai Motor India Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hyundai Motor Company headquartered in South Korea. It is the second largest automobile manufacturer with 16.2% market share as of February 2019 and US$5.5 billion turn-over in India.

                Hyundai Motor India Limited was formed on 6 May 1996 by the Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea. When Hyundai Motor Company entered the Indian automobile market in 1996 the Hyundai brand was almost unknown throughout India.
                During the entry of Hyundai in 1996, there were only five major automobile manufacturers in India, i.e. Maruti, Hindustan, Premier, Tata and Mahindra. Daewoo had entered the Indian automobile market with Cielo just three years back while Ford, Opel and Honda had entered less than a year back.
                For more than a decade till Hyundai arrived, Maruti Suzuki had a near monopoly over the passenger cars segment because Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra were solely utility and commercial vehicle manufacturers, while Hindustan and Premier both built outdated and uncompetitive products.
             <br><br>
             HMIL's first car, the Hyundai Santro was launched on 23 September 1998 and was a runaway success. Within a few months of its inception HMIL became the second largest automobile manufacturer and the largest automobile exporter in India. Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hyundai Motor Company (HMC), South Korea and is the largest passenger car exporter and the second largest car manufacturer in India.

HMC has set up a research and development facility (Hyundai Motor India Engineering – HMIE) in the cyber city of Hyderabad.

As HMC's global export hub for compact cars, HMIL is the first automotive company in India to achieve the export of 10 lakh cars in just over a decade. HMIL currently exports cars to more than 87 countries. It has been the number one exporter of passenger cars of the country for the eighth year in a row.[2]
To support its growth and expansion plans, HMIL currently has 1200 strong dealer network and more than 1,309 strong service points across India.
In July 2012, Arvind Saxena, the Director of Marketing and Sales stepped down from the position after serving the company for seven years.[3]
In August 2018, Rakesh Srivastava, Director of Sales and Marketing at Hyundai India, resigned from his position after serving for six years.
On 4 December 2018, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, announced the top level management changes with immediate effect. Seon Seob Kim assumed the responsibilities of MD and CEO from Young Key Koo.
